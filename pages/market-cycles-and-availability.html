      <h1>Market Cycles & Availability</h1>
    </div>

<p>
    Apparent shortages of filament, printers, and accessories are rarely random. They follow predictable cycles tied to
    holidays, production constraints, and global logistics.
  </p>

  <h2>Holiday demand lag</h2>
  <p>
    Printers are common holiday gifts, but filament and accessory buying often spikes weeks later—when people redeem gift cards,
    finish setup, or finally have time to print. This delayed wave typically hits in <strong>January</strong>, not December.
  </p>

  <h2>Production constraints</h2>
  <p>
    Many 3D printing products cannot be replenished instantly. Filament requires extrusion, color changeovers, drying, spooling,
    and QC. Hardware and accessories require assembly capacity, testing, and staged logistics. When stock runs out, restocks may
    land weeks or months later.
  </p>

  <h2>SKU prioritization</h2>
  <p>
    During tight supply, manufacturers and distributors prioritize high-volume “safe” items (common models, neutral filament colors).
    That’s why unusual colors or niche variants may remain available while common options sell out.
  </p>

  <h2>Shipping and seasonal shutdowns</h2>
  <p>
    Ocean freight lead times and seasonal factory slowdowns can add more delay. In particular, many suppliers are affected by
    Lunar New Year shutdowns (late January / early February), which commonly aligns with “restock in February” messaging.
  </p>

  <h2>Practical expectations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>December:</strong> hardware sells heavily</li>
    <li><strong>January–February:</strong> spotty availability</li>
    <li><strong>Spring:</strong> inventory stabilizes</li>
    <li><strong>Mid-year:</strong> best selection and pricing</li>
  </ul>

    Tip: If the manufacturer store is out of stock, large marketplaces sometimes fill the gap—but availability and consistency can vary.
