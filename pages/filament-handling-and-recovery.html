<p class="muted">Practical ways to keep prints moving and make use of leftover filament — including manual swaps and splicing options.</p>
<h2>Splicing (DIY + tools)</h2>
<h1>Filament Splicing Guide (DIY + Tools)</h1>
<h2>What “filament splicing” means</h2>
<p>Filament splicing is joining two pieces of filament end-to-end so you can: - Use up short leftovers - Continue a print (manual swap) without wasting a long tail - Create simple color changes without an AMS</p>
<p>Goal: a straight, smooth joint that won’t jam in the extruder path.</p>
<h2>When splicing is worth doing</h2>
<p>Best use cases - You have several short ends you’d otherwise toss - You’re doing manual color changes (no AMS/AMS Lite) - You’re running long prints and want to reduce spool waste</p>
<p>When to skip it - You rarely end up with short pieces - You print very high-speed profiles where any diameter bump risks a feed issue - Your filament path is extremely tight/curvy and unforgiving</p>
<h2>Core principles (this is what makes splices succeed)</h2>
<p>Alignment: the two ends must be straight and centered.</p>
<p>Surface area: cutting at ~45° increases bonding area.</p>
<p>Controlled heat: soften the plastic—don’t boil, scorch, or drip.</p>
<p>Diameter control: remove/trim any “bulge” so it can feed reliably.</p>
<h2>Tools you probably already have</h2>
<p>Flush cutters or a sharp blade</p>
<p>Heat source: lighter, candle, heat gun, or soldering iron</p>
<p>Optional: pliers/tweezers to hold filament safely</p>
<h2>DIY Splicing Methods (no purchases required)</h2>
<h3>Method 1: PTFE/Bowden-tube alignment (best if you have any scrap)</h3>
<p>What it is: A short piece of PTFE tube (often called “Bowden tube”) used as an alignment sleeve.</p>
<p>Steps 1. Cut both filament ends to ~45°. 2. Slide one end into the PTFE tube. 3. Warm both angled ends until slightly glossy/soft. 4. Press together inside the tube and hold straight. 5. Let cool ~10–15 seconds. 6. Remove and trim any bulge.</p>
<p>Why it works: the tube forces alignment and helps control diameter.</p>
<h3>Method 2: Paperclip alignment (100% free, surprisingly effective)</h3>
<p>What it is: A metal paperclip bent into a shallow “U” channel to keep the filament straight.</p>
<p>Steps 1. Straighten a paperclip and bend it into a shallow U. 2. Cut ends to ~45°. 3. Heat ends until they soften. 4. Press together while seated in the U. 5. Hold steady until cool. 6. Lightly smooth/trim the joint.</p>
<p>Tip: keep hands away from the softened plastic—use pliers/tweezers if needed.</p>
<h3>Method 3: “Printed-hole” alignment (uses any scrap print)</h3>
<p>What it is: Any printed part with a straight hole around ~1.8–2.0 mm can act as a sleeve.</p>
<p>Steps 1. Find a straight hole in a scrap print (test cube, bracket, etc.). 2. Use it exactly like the PTFE tube method: insert → heat → press → cool → trim.</p>
<p>Why it works: a rigid hole keeps alignment without needing PTFE.</p>
<h3>Method 4: Household sleeve (pen tube / stirrer)</h3>
<p>What it is: A thin rigid tube that won’t melt at your working distance.</p>
<p>Good candidates - Empty pen ink tube (cleaned) - Thin coffee stirrer (rigid type) - Mechanical pencil tube (empty)</p>
<p>Avoid - Soft plastics that collapse/melt easily</p>
<h2>Material notes (quick guidance)</h2>
<p>PLA / PLA+: easiest to splice; cools fast.</p>
<p>PETG: doable; heat gently (PETG can string and form bigger bulges).</p>
<p>TPU: possible but tricky; go slow and keep alignment perfect.</p>
<p>ABS / Nylon: less forgiving; better results with a controlled tool/jig.</p>
<h2>Common mistakes (and how to avoid them)</h2>
<p>Tape / heat-shrink: usually creates a bump and can jam.</p>
<p>Super glue: becomes brittle and can snap in the feed path.</p>
<p>Overheating: causes a large “donut” bulge that won’t pass cleanly.</p>
<h2>Quick quality check</h2>
<p>Before feeding into your printer: 1. Run fingers along the splice: it should feel smooth. 2. Bend gently: it should not crack immediately. 3. If there’s a bump: trim carefully and re-check smoothness.</p>
<h2>Filament splicer tools (optional)</h2>
<p>A filament splicer tool is basically a purpose-built alignment + cutting + joining jig. - Helpful if you splice often and want repeatability. - Not required for occasional splices.</p>
<p>Example product: Sunlu filament splicer/slicer tools can make angled cuts and alignment easier, but the DIY methods above can achieve very similar results when done carefully.</p>
